          <h1>Neural Network</h1>

          <section>
          <p> A neural network is a computer program that takes an input and performs a sequence of mathematical operations on it. The output of the program for classification is a list of probabilities for all the classes that have been programmed into the network. The network is given a large amount of labelled data to train it, so that the probabilities are accurate for never-before-seen data. There are different architectures of models that all have various trade offs, from size and complexity, to speed and efficiency. Regardless, they all are still essentially learing to perform the same task. Networks can be easily modified to best suit the needs of the setup, and there is no exact science to picking a neural network. The only general rule of thumb to follow is that for smaller numbers of classes there is less need for a large network, so smaller networks with a few number of layers will work just fine (some examples being squeezenet and resnet18). For systems with a large amount of classes, a deeper network may be needed to learn the complexity of the landmarks (some examples being densenet and vggnet50). Customer requirements alone will not narrow the number of options down to a single network (unless they specify which network they want used), so it can be helpful to either try a couple and go with the best one, or to pick a network that has been extensively tested by other people. For tighter control it is even possible to build a custom network, though this may be overkill.
