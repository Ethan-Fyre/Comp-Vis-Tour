          <section>
          <p> If the company does not have an app already, or needs an app developed a new one will be made. It must be made to function on both iOS and Android devices. The app must be able to take a picture with the user device, then transmit the image to the server along with a command to run the neural network program on the image. The app must then wait until the response comes back from the network, and display the information to the user.
