          <p> The network will be given images from the training dataset in batches, and will compute the loss (or inaccuracy). It will then backpropagate the error through the network to update the network. Once all of the images in the dataset have been processed the epoch will be over. The network will train for a set number of epochs before being tested on the validation dataset.
