          <h1>Network Training</h1>

          <section>
          <p> The network is written in the programming language python, using a library called pytorch that has been optimised for neural networks. Training takes place over "epochs" in which the network will predict the output classes, then determine how inaccurate it did, and then use that to update itself through a mathematical concept called backpropagation. Without getting too technical, backpropagation involves each layer "knowing" how much it contributed to the inaccuracy or "loss" as it is called. The layers then update accordingly, allowing the good layers to remain unchanged, and the faulty layers to attempt to get better accuracy.
