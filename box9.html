          <p> The dataset containing all the images will be split into two datasets with no overlap. The typical spilt is an 80/20 split, with the larger chunk being the training dataset, and the smaller dataset being the validation dataset. This splitting is performed randomly, so as not to introduce any bias in the images used for training and validation. The training dataset is used for training the network. The network will attempt to update in a manner to match the training images. The validation dataset is used to test the network on data it has not seen. The network is not permitted to update in response to the validation dataset, as this would allow the network to essentially memorise the exact data it has seen (this is called overfitting).
