          <h1>Hyperparameters </h1>

          <section>
          <p> There are multiple parameters that must be set by the programmer before the network can begin training. These are refered to as hyperparameters, and the network can not learn theme. There is the learning rate, which controls the rate of exponential decay used for gradient descent (this ensures that the network gradually takes smaller steps in correcting itself). The batch size, and the number of epochs are some other hyperparameters. Adjusting hyperparameters is a guessing game, and can be done as a manual search, a grid search, a random search, or some sort of optimisation to find the best combination.
