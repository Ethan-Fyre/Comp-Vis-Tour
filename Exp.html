          <h1>Exponentiation</h1>

          <section>
          <p> This page contains an exponentiation calculator. You enter the base and the power, and the program will compute the resulting exponentiation. As an aside, exponentiation is essentially repeated multiplication of a base. The simple way of computing an exponentiation is to multiply the base by itself by the amount of times specified by the power.

          <p> The exponentiation will only properly function if an integer is entered for both the base and the power. Anything other than an integer will cause the program to refuse to perform the exponentiation. It is a picky algorithm, so if you don't treat it right it will not function. </p>
