          <section>
          <p> The camera team must take videos of all the landmarks specified in the product order. The landmark in question must be centered in the video in order for it to be used effectively for training. The videos should try to include some examples of occlusion (this is when an object partially obscures the landmark from view), as that can help the network to gain some resiliancy, but too much occlusion may be harmful. The team should collect videos during multiple settings to build time and weather invariance in the network.
