          <h1>Base 10 to Binary Converter</h1>

          <section>
          <p> This page contains a base 10 to binary converter. By inputting a base 10 value into the form below you can see what the equivalent binary value is. In order to calculate this equivalent value, the division/remainder algorithm is implemented. This algorithm performs the following steps: </p>
	<ul>
	   <li> Perform modulo division by 2 to get the next bit from the right
	   <li> Divide the value by 2 (ignoring the remainder)
	   <li> Perform modulo division on this value to get the next bit from the right
	   <li> Repeat until you are done.
	</ul>

      <aside id="asideStory">
          <p> The converter will only properly function if an integer is entered. Anything other than an integer will cause the program to refuse to convert the value. It is a picky algorithm, so if you don't treat it right it will not convert. </p>
